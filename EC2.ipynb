    "\n",
    "What is ec2 instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "go to aws\n",
    "click EC2\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we are deploying the entire ml project in ec2 instance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click EC2\n",
    "2. Click Instances\n",
    "3. Launch New Instances\n",
    "   (i)  give names and tags\n",
    "  (ii) choose machine (amazon linux machine)\n",
    " (iii) choose ami (amazon machine image) and bit (by default)\n",
    "4. choose instance type (t2.micro free tier)\n",
    "5. key pair login (it is nothing but, in order to use the particular instance we need that key pair)\n",
    "    give the key pair name & download the .pem file\n",
    "\n",
    "6. just click launch instance\n",
    "7. go to ec2 and click instance, there our instance has been created\n",
    "\n",
    "I have started my instance, basically, I have created a server in somewhere in the cloud,\n",
    "In that particular cloud, I have a linux software system, I have a cpu, I have some information over there, I have a resources, I have some harddisk over there.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I want to do this now is,\n",
    "I have take my entire code and put it over there\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "now, how to be deploy that code in that linux server? \n",
    "\n",
    "we have connecting to the vm (virtual machine)\n",
    "but how can we connect?\n",
    "\n",
    " basically there is a putty, now we have to use putty.\n",
    "\n",
    "just download the putty generator for windows and winscp\n",
    "\n",
    "8. open putty gen\n",
    "\n",
    "putty key generator\n",
    "\n",
    "why putty key generator?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tconvert from .pem to .ppk\n",
    "\tit will create a .ppk file\n",
    "\t.ppk file full form is nothing but, it is a public private key pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. click load in putty key generator\n",
    "10. select that downloaded pem file\n",
    "\tthen we will get a successfully imported box\n",
    "\n",
    "11. now we need to save it, how?\n",
    "save it in a private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "save in the directory, with same file name of .pem file\n",
    "(here our pem file name is testrevenue.pem)\n",
    "so I saved in the name of testrevenue.ppk\n",
    "\n",
    "now file was saved\n",
    "\n",
    "then close the putty gen\n",
    "\n",
    "now go back to putty\n",
    "\n",
    "12. open putty\n",
    "\n",
    "this putty will actually help me to connect to the ec2 instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "ok now we have to connect to the ec2 instance\n",
    "\n",
    "\t(i) host name - where we find?\n",
    "\t\t\tgo back to aws instance, just scroll to the right hand side, there you can find the public ipv4, just copy it. and paste it over here.\n",
    "\t(ii) then now, we have to named that session, in saved sessions box, just give the name, testrevenue\n",
    "\n",
    "\t(iii) in next thing we have to do, go in connection and select data, inside this data, there is asking for auto login username\n",
    "\n",
    "\twhere do i get this login username?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tgo to aws, and select that instance, and click connect, inside the connect go to ec2 instance connect, there we can able to find out the username, here our user name is ubuntu.(by default),\n",
    "\tso here, in putty, I am also going to write default name.\n",
    "\tin my aws, i have a default name that is ec2-user, so here I am going to write the ec2-user.\n",
    "\n",
    "next step\n",
    "\n",
    "\t(iv) go to SSH, & click auth,\n",
    "\tinside this auth, there is asking for the private key file for authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\twhere I can it? \n",
    "\n",
    "\twe downloaded .ppk file before,\n",
    "\twhereever I downloaded the .ppk file, i have to put over here. so that it will be able to login or use that particular instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tclick browse and select that converted ppk file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t(v) now go back to session in putty gen.\n",
    "\tclick putty gen. in saved session box, i just written a test_revenue, i just go and save it.\n",
    "\n",
    "so that i will not lose that particular data, suppose if get disconnected to that particular data, then again I have to fillup all these informations, so now save it the saved session name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t(vi) now select that saved session name, (test_revenue)\n",
    "\n",
    "\tselect test_revenue and click open\n",
    "\n",
    "then we will get a warning box, just click yes, \n",
    "\n",
    "now one new cmd will open, that is nothing but, it is our ubuntu terminal prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "now I am inside that ec2 instance, which is there in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "this is the bash terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "now, just do pip install pandas, \n",
    "it is showing pip command not found\n",
    "\n",
    "then i check python3, it is available,\n",
    "then i clear the screen using clear command\n",
    "\n",
    "now the next thing is that, \n",
    "\n",
    "13. I have to push all the entire files (entire project files and folders) files to my ec2 instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "how do we push it?\n",
    "\n",
    "in order to do, there is a another tool, that is winscp.\n",
    "\n",
    "here winscp comes into the picture. (we can use filezilla as well.)\n",
    "\n",
    "14. now go to app.py file,\n",
    "\n",
    "\tinside that, we have to make some changes.\n",
    "that is he used one 1 deep learning result in that project out of 3. so he just comment it, because in cloud there is a 1gb of ram, so he just commented that deep learning project code inside the app.py\n",
    "\n",
    "\tinside the app.run we have return debug=True,\n",
    "instead of that, we need to change that to host=0.0.0.0, and port=8080\n",
    "\n",
    "why we need to change it?\n",
    "why specifically 0.0.0.0 and 8080, because by default, if you are try to use some http protocol or all the traffic protocal in aws instance, it wil taking the by default port as 8080 and  and it will be taking the default ip as 0.0.0.0, so instead of writing app.run(debug=True),\n",
    "write like this\n",
    "\n",
    "15. after downlaoding the winscp just install it.\n",
    "now open winscp\n",
    "\n",
    "\t(i) it will asking again the host name,\n",
    "\twhere can I find this?\n",
    "\tgo to ec2 instance, there public ip address is available, just copy it and paste it over here. in new site (inside the host name paste it)\n",
    "\n",
    "\t(ii) then give the username, that is bydefault name give it. (for krish it is ubuntu, for me it is ec2-user)\n",
    "\n",
    "\t(iii) Then click advance\n",
    "\n",
    "\t(iv) there in SSH ----> Authentication, we have to put our ppk file here also.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t(v) then click ok\n",
    "\n",

    "so just drag & drop the required files & folders only,\n",
    "\n",
    "he have a procfile in local & but he dont need that in ubutu (cloud), because procfile is for heroku platform.\n",
